# theJukebox/Jokebox

#Purpose
The 'Jokebox' was created so people can hear great stand-up bits from some of their favorite comedians! Utilizing Javascript, jQuery, HTML and Scss, we developed the Jokebox to play, load, pause, stop, go to the next and pick a random bit. 

#Use
Users can load up a comedian from the list (Louis CK, Aziz Ansari, Amy Schumer, Hannibal Burress and George Carlin) and go through the above mentioned functions. Upon loading, Louis CK is at the mic but that can be changed by just clicking another comedian's photo. 

#Main Focus
Our main focuse was making this extremely object oriented. Check out our Jukebox.js file!
